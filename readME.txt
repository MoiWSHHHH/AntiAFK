Do not move the antiAFK.exe file; you can only move the shortcut of the AntiAFK file.

1 Launch antiAFK.exe or the AntiAFK shortcut.

2 Next, complete the maximum delay before being kicked.

3 Click on START, then return to your game.

4 Your character will jump once every second for 10 seconds, 
  and then will jump more or less at each delay mentioned above. 
  IMPORTANT: leave your game open and in the foreground, otherwise 
  your character will not jump. (Yes, the variable time is there to 
  avoid arousing server suspicions)

5 Click on STOP to end or close the application.

Why does your character jump 10 times at the beginning? It is to give 
you time to select your game and check if your keyboard inputs are 
properly recognized by the game. This prevents any malfunction.
